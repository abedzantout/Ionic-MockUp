# iEdit

## What is iEdit ?

iEdit is Web application to easily configure a structured ionic (cross platform) application. 
This will help to create the core of an ionic application (or a template) and create, 
using the web interface, different configurations, and thus different applications, with respect to the client needs.

This application was build for our final year project, CMPS 299 at the American University of Beirut (AUB).

This project was also done in collaboration with ArabiaGIS.

## Release

This release is an alpha release, with no intention to resume working on the project anytime soon.
